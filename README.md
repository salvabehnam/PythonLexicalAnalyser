# 🐍 Python Lexical Analyzer

This project implements a **lexical analyzer** in Python that utilizes **regular expressions** to tokenize source code into components such as identifiers, keywords, operators, and more. It's designed to serve as a foundational element for building compilers or interpreters.

## 📌 Features

- **Tokenization**: Breaks down source code into fundamental tokens.
- **Regular Expressions**: Employs regex patterns for efficient lexical analysis.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a base that can be expanded for more complex language parsing.

## ✨ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the lexical analyzer.
- **Regular Expressions**: Utilized for pattern matching and tokenization.
